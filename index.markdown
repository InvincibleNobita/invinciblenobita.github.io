I love **Algorithmic Challenges** and I like to participate in **Competitive Programming** contests and **Hackathons** in my free time.

I've also tried my hands at **web and app development** and I'm fully inclined to dive into **Machine Learning** as soon as I build a strong base on Data Structures, Algorithms and Mathematics.
